# Satellite-Navigation-from-Multiple-Measurement-Methods
To determine satellite orbits, multiple methods can be used.  These measurements can be GPS coordinates, ground station range, azimuth and elevation measurements, or other less conventional methods.  This repository aims and creating an orbital estimation with uncertainty using GPS and RA and DEC measurements from ground stations.
